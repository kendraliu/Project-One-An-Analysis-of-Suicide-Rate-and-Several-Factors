We found that higher income does affect mental health negatively, as wealthier nations have higher suicide rates than poorer ones. The vast majority of those affected being male. We can also conclude that there is a large decrease in suicide rates in younger generations due mental health being more socially accepted. 


Suicide Rates by Generation

Based on the data found, suicide rates are not dependant on the country’s standard of living but rather the factors and events that the generation experienced.

Gender affect on suicide rates:

We found that 65% of them are male and 35% being female. There are other factors found such as generations that accept mental illnesses, seek help and lower the statistics.

Household Income vs. Suicide rates: 

From the analysis we made,  the correlation coefficient (r-value) indicated no correlation of household income with the suicide rates of a country.

Country HDI vs Suicide rates

Based on the data found, suicide rates are not dependant on the country’s HDI score and instead have an negative effect on suicide rates as there is a weak positive correlation in our dataset.

Household Income vs. Mental Disorders:

We found that schizophrenia (r-value=0.79), eating disorders (r-value=0.68), anxiety disorder (r-value=0.85), depression (r-value=0.55), and drug use disorder (r-value=0.41) all have a positive correlation with household income. On the contrary, alcohol use disorder has a weak negative correlation with household income (r-value=-0.37). At the meantime, bipolar disorder does not have a correlation with household income (r-value=0.23).
